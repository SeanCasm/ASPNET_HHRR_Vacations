# ASPNET HHRR Vacations
ASP.NET MVC web application for simple employee administration, using SQLServer and Entity Framework Core database first.

The application acts like a web portal for employees, where employees can request vacations and an administrator can approve or decline those requests. Adminsitrators also can **CREATE**, **READ**, **UPDATE** and **DELETE** employees data.

## User creator
Also a console application is included in the proyect just for create administrators or employees credentials.

Both applications **works** in **localhost**, more improvements are in mind to make the application more robust.

### Note
Developed just for experience proof in ASP.NET environment.
